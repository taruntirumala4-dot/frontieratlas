The term spans two paradigms: internal world models that predict the future at a high, semantic level (cognitive sense, in the spirit of LeCun's JEPA family) and external world models that aim to simulate reality at full visual fidelity (e.g. Genie-2, GAIA-1). Both are foundational for embodied AI: agents can plan and act using internal models while learning inside external simulators.",
